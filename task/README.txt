🧪 ChatGPT Messaging Panel Task – Instructions

Welcome! This task is designed to test your ability to:

✅ Build a React-based messaging panel
✅ Integrate with an AI backend (ChatGPT-style suggestion system)
✅ Simulate real-time interaction logic

---

📁 What's Included:
- App.jsx (React frontend)
- server.js (Mock backend using Node.js + Express)

---

🧠 Your Task:

1. **Frontend (React)**
   - Improve the message input UX (press Enter to send, auto-focus, etc.)
   - Add basic message grouping (user vs agent roles)
   - Style the suggestion list as clickable buttons
   - Add “click to insert” functionality for suggestions
   - Add a typing indicator before suggestions are shown

2. **Backend (Node)**
   - Expand mock ChatGPT logic: handle different kinds of inputs
   - Optional: Add delay or error simulation to test fallback handling

3. **Bonus (if you're strong):**
   - Replace mock backend with real OpenAI Assistant API call
   - Add multiple agents simulation
   - Session management or WebSocket simulation
